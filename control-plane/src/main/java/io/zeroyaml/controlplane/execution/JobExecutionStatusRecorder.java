/**
 * Applies Runner execution reports to the Jobs the Control Plane owns.
 *
 * <p>The Runner reports facts; this component decides what each fact means for
 * the Job lifecycle. Every report is reconciled against the recorded state, so
 * the same report may be delivered any number of times and in any order without
 * corrupting the lifecycle:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>a report the Job already records, or has moved past, is a
 *       {@link JobStatusReportDecision#DUPLICATE} and changes nothing;</li>
 *   <li>a terminal report for a Job that is still queued starts the Job from
 *       the reported start time first, so a <em>lost</em> running report cannot
 *       leave a finished execution without a Job outcome;</li>
 *   <li>a report that contradicts the recorded state, or that comes from a
 *       process the Job is not assigned to, is a
 *       {@link JobStatusReportDecision#CONFLICT} and leaves the Job untouched.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Reconciliation runs with exclusive access to the Job through
 * {@link JobStore#update}, so concurrent reports for one Job are serialized.</p>
