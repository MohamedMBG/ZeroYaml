/**
 * First scheduling strategy: pick the available registered Runner with the
 * lexicographically smallest {@code runnerId}.
 *
 * <p>Eligibility is the registry's decision. A Runner is eligible exactly when
 * {@link RunnerRegistry#availableRunners()} lists it: its heartbeat is recent,
 * and that heartbeat reported the Runner ready and accepting work. A Runner
 * that is alive but cannot execute, for example one without a Docker daemon
 * or one that is draining, is therefore never selected and cannot keep Jobs
 * away from a Runner that can run them.
 *
 * <p>{@code runnerId} is the registry key and therefore unique, so the
 * ordering is total and the same registry state always yields the same
 * Runner, regardless of registration order or map iteration order. The
 * strategy is intentionally stateless: it does not rotate, track load, or
 * reserve the Runner it returns. Concurrent callers can be handed the same
 * Runner; capacity and leasing belong to later scheduling work.
