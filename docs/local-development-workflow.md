# Local End-to-End Development Workflow

This document is the reproducible path from a clean checkout to a verified
local ZeroYAML environment: which services to start and in which order, how to
configure them, how to send the supported signed GitHub `push` delivery, what
each boundary is expected to log and persist, and what to check when a boundary
fails.

It is a runbook. Reference material it would otherwise duplicate stays in
[`DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`](../DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) and in
[`docs/architecture/`](./architecture); this document links to it at the step
where it is needed.

Out of scope: production deployment, Kubernetes, and user-facing product
documentation.

## 1. The rule every step follows

> The Control Plane decides and coordinates; the Runner executes.

The Control Plane terminates the GitHub webhook, authenticates the delivery,
owns connected-repository metadata, owns authoritative Job state, and decides
what runs. The Runner executes one dispatched Job in Docker and reports what
that execution did. A Runner never learns scheduling, retry, or pipeline
policy, and the Control Plane never runs a Job command itself. A local
observation that contradicts that split is a defect, not a configuration
question.

## 2. What the documented path covers today

Phase 2 is in delivery, so the push-to-execution chain is wired at both ends
and not yet joined in the middle. The table states which step this document can
reproduce and which it cannot, so missing wiring stays distinguishable from a
broken environment.

| Step | State | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local infrastructure starts | Wired | [Section 4](#4-startup-order) |
| Control Plane starts, applies migrations, serves HTTP and the Runner-facing gRPC endpoint | Wired | [Section 4](#4-startup-order) |
| Runner starts, probes Docker, registers, heartbeats | Wired | [Section 4](#4-startup-order) |
| Connected repository metadata is persisted | Wired; no HTTP API yet | [Section 6](#6-connect-a-repository) |
| A signed `push` delivery is authenticated and accepted | Wired | [Section 7](#7-trigger-the-supported-push-scenario) |
| An accepted delivery is normalized into an internal event | Not wired — [#20](https://github.com/MohamedMBG/ZeroYaml/issues/20) | [Section 7](#7-trigger-the-supported-push-scenario) |
| A pipeline is inferred for the repository | Not wired — [#21](https://github.com/MohamedMBG/ZeroYaml/issues/21), [#22](https://github.com/MohamedMBG/ZeroYaml/issues/22) | [Section 9](#9-expected-states) |
| Executable Jobs are created and recorded | Not wired — [#23](https://github.com/MohamedMBG/ZeroYaml/issues/23) | [Section 9](#9-expected-states) |
| A healthy Runner is selected and the Job is dispatched | Not wired — [#24](https://github.com/MohamedMBG/ZeroYaml/issues/24) | [Section 9](#9-expected-states) |
| A dispatched Job runs in Docker and reports running and terminal status | Wired | [Section 8](#8-observe-one-job-execution) |
| Job logs are streamed and captured | Not wired — [#26](https://github.com/MohamedMBG/ZeroYaml/issues/26) | [Section 9](#9-expected-states) |
| Job state survives a Control Plane restart | Not wired — [#28](https://github.com/MohamedMBG/ZeroYaml/issues/28) | [Section 9](#9-expected-states) |
| Lifecycle events are published | Not wired — [#29](https://github.com/MohamedMBG/ZeroYaml/issues/29) | [Section 3](#3-prerequisites) |
| One push produces one executed pipeline | Not wired — [#30](https://github.com/MohamedMBG/ZeroYaml/issues/30) | [Section 9](#9-expected-states) |
| An automated test covers the whole chain | Not wired — [#31](https://github.com/MohamedMBG/ZeroYaml/issues/31) | [Section 11](#11-automated-coverage) |

Sections 7 and 8 are therefore two verifiable halves rather than one continuous
run: a delivery stops at the Control Plane audit record, and an execution is
started by dispatching a Job directly to the Runner. Issue
[#30](https://github.com/MohamedMBG/ZeroYaml/issues/30) joins them, and
[#31](https://github.com/MohamedMBG/ZeroYaml/issues/31) adds the automated test
this document must then be checked against.

## 3. Prerequisites

| Tool | Needed for |
| --- | --- |
| Git | Checkout, and the local repository used as a Job source |
| Docker Desktop with Compose | Infrastructure, Control Plane tests, and every Job execution |
| Java 21 | Control Plane |
| Go, version from `runner/go.mod` | Runner |
| `curl` | Sending a local webhook delivery |
| `grpcurl` | Dispatching a Job by hand ([Section 8](#8-observe-one-job-execution)) |
| `psql`, or another PostgreSQL client | Persistence checks |

Verify the toolchain before starting anything:

```powershell
git --version
java -version
go version
docker --version
docker compose version
```

`infra/compose.yaml` also defines Redis and Kafka. Neither has a consumer yet —
the Control Plane declares no Redis or Kafka dependency — so this workflow
starts PostgreSQL only. Lifecycle event publishing is tracked as
[#29](https://github.com/MohamedMBG/ZeroYaml/issues/29).

## 4. Startup order

The order matters in one direction only: the Control Plane needs PostgreSQL to
start at all, and the Runner needs the Control Plane to accept it into the
registry. A Runner started earlier does not crash — it stays unavailable and
rejects every dispatch until it is restarted after the Control Plane is up,
because startup registration and the Docker probe each run once.

### 4.1 Infrastructure

```powershell
docker compose -f .\infra\compose.yaml up -d postgres
docker compose -f .\infra\compose.yaml ps
```

```bash
docker compose -f ./infra/compose.yaml up -d postgres
docker compose -f ./infra/compose.yaml ps
```

Expect `zeroyaml-postgres` running with `5432` published. Its data lives in the
`postgres-data` volume, so the schema and connected-repository rows survive a
restart of the stack.

### 4.2 Control Plane

Both required secrets come from the environment; read
[Section 5](#5-configuration-and-secret-handling) before running this.

The webhook secret is generated once into a file in the home directory, outside
the checkout, and loaded from there. The signed delivery in
[Section 7.1](#71-signed-local-delivery) is sent from a different shell and
needs the identical value; loading it from the file in both shells shares it
without ever printing it.

```powershell
$secretFile = Join-Path $HOME '.zeroyaml-webhook-secret'
if (-not (Test-Path $secretFile)) {
  $bytes = New-Object byte[] 32
  $rng = [Security.Cryptography.RandomNumberGenerator]::Create()
  $rng.GetBytes($bytes)
  $rng.Dispose()
  [IO.File]::WriteAllText($secretFile, (($bytes | ForEach-Object { $_.ToString('x2') }) -join ''))
}

$env:ZEROYAML_DATABASE_PASSWORD = 'zeroyaml'
$env:ZEROYAML_GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET = [IO.File]::ReadAllText($secretFile)

Push-Location control-plane
.\mvnw.cmd --batch-mode spring-boot:run
Pop-Location
```

```bash
secret_file="$HOME/.zeroyaml-webhook-secret"
[ -f "$secret_file" ] || (umask 077; openssl rand -hex 32 | tr -d '\n' > "$secret_file")

export ZEROYAML_DATABASE_PASSWORD='zeroyaml'
export ZEROYAML_GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET="$(cat "$secret_file")"

cd control-plane && ./mvnw --batch-mode spring-boot:run
```

`RandomNumberGenerator` is a cryptographically secure source on Windows
PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell 7 alike; `Get-Random` is not, so it is not used
for a secret.

Expected during startup:

- Flyway applies `V1__create_repository_connection.sql` and reports the schema
  version it migrated to, before the service accepts traffic;
- the HTTP port is bound on `8080`, the Spring Boot default, because
  `application.properties` sets no `server.port`;
- the runner-facing gRPC endpoint is bound on `zeroyaml.registration.port`
  (default `50052`). It hosts `RunnerRegistrationService` and
  `JobExecutionStatusService` on one listener, so a Runner is configured with a
  single Control Plane address.

Confirm it is serving:

```powershell
curl.exe -s http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
```

A missing webhook secret or database password stops startup with an actionable
message; both are listed in [Section 10](#10-troubleshooting).

### 4.3 Runner

In a second shell. `ZEROYAML_RUNNER_LOCAL_SOURCE_ROOT` is only needed for the
`file://` Job source used in [Section 8](#8-observe-one-job-execution).

```powershell
$env:ZEROYAML_RUNNER_LOCAL_SOURCE_ROOT = 'C:\zeroyaml-sources'

Push-Location runner
go run ./cmd/runner
Pop-Location
```

```bash
export ZEROYAML_RUNNER_LOCAL_SOURCE_ROOT="$HOME/zeroyaml-sources"

cd runner && go run ./cmd/runner
```

Expected output, in this order:

```text
level=INFO msg="docker daemon available" docker_version=...
Runner local-runner registered with the Control Plane at localhost:50052 - registration <uuid> - result accepted
ZeroYAML Runner gRPC server listening on :50051 - runner local-runner - instance <uuid> - version 0.1.0 - protocol runner.v1
```

A Runner accepts Jobs only when registration was accepted **and** the Docker
daemon answered the startup probe. If either fails, it keeps serving `Ping` and
`GetInfo` for diagnosis but rejects every dispatch with
`JOB_REJECTION_RUNNER_UNAVAILABLE` rather than failing later inside the
sandbox. The heartbeat loop starts only after an accepted registration and then
sends a heartbeat every `ZEROYAML_RUNNER_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL` (default `5s`);
the Control Plane reports the registry entry `UNAVAILABLE` once
`zeroyaml.registration.heartbeat-timeout` (default `15s`) passes without one.

`:50051` is the Runner's configurable default, not a fixed port. Override it
with `ZEROYAML_RUNNER_GRPC_ADDRESS` and point the Control Plane at the new
value with `ZEROYAML_RUNNER_PORT`.

## 5. Configuration and secret handling

The complete property and environment-variable tables are in
[`DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`](../DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md#10-prerequisites). The values this
workflow will not start without:

| Setting | Component | Local value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ZEROYAML_GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Control Plane | Generated per developer; at least 16 characters |
| `ZEROYAML_DATABASE_PASSWORD` | Control Plane | `zeroyaml`, matching `infra/compose.yaml` |
| `ZEROYAML_DATABASE_URL` | Control Plane | Default `jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/zeroyaml` |
| `ZEROYAML_CONTROLPLANE_ADDRESS` | Runner | Default `localhost:50052` |
| `ZEROYAML_RUNNER_LOCAL_SOURCE_ROOT` | Runner | Absolute directory holding local Job sources; empty disables `file://` |

### Handling the webhook secret safely

- Generate a high-entropy value per developer and per environment. The Control
  Plane refuses to start on a secret shorter than 16 characters, because a
  guessable secret makes signature verification decorative.
- Keep it in the shell environment or an approved secret store. It has no value
  in `application.properties` on purpose, and it must never be committed,
  pasted into an issue or pull request, or written to a tracked file.
- Set the identical value on the GitHub webhook. A mismatch is
  indistinguishable from a forged delivery and is answered `401`.
- Never reuse a shared or production secret for local work, and rotate the
  local value if it was ever echoed into a terminal transcript or a log file.
- The verifier authenticates every delivery against this one configured secret.
  Per-repository secret resolution is not wired: the
  `webhook_secret_reference` column records only the *name* of a secret, never
  its value, and nothing reads it during verification yet.

Startup validation is deliberate. Invalid configuration fails at startup with
an actionable message instead of failing on the first delivery.

## 6. Connect a repository

Issues [#18](https://github.com/MohamedMBG/ZeroYaml/issues/18) and
[#19](https://github.com/MohamedMBG/ZeroYaml/issues/19) delivered the
`RepositoryConnection` aggregate and its PostgreSQL store. No HTTP API exposes
them yet — `GitHubWebhookController` is the Control Plane's only REST
controller — so a local connection record is inserted directly. Webhook
authentication does not depend on this record; it is what later phases read to
decide which repository a delivery belongs to.

```powershell
docker exec -i zeroyaml-postgres psql -U zeroyaml -d zeroyaml -c "INSERT INTO repository_connection (provider, owner, name, default_branch, webhook_secret_reference, status, connected_at, status_changed_at) VALUES ('GITHUB', 'mohamedmbg', 'zeroyaml', 'main', 'local-dev-webhook-secret', 'ACTIVE', now(), now());"
```

The table constraints mirror the domain rules, so a row that contradicts them
is refused: `provider` must be `GITHUB`, `owner` and `name` must be lowercase,
`status` must be one of `PENDING`, `ACTIVE`, `SUSPENDED`, `DISCONNECTED`,
`status_changed_at` must not precede `connected_at`, and one repository can be
connected only once. `webhook_secret_reference` holds a name only; storing a
secret value there would be a security defect.

Read it back:

```powershell
docker exec -i zeroyaml-postgres psql -U zeroyaml -d zeroyaml -c "SELECT provider, owner, name, default_branch, status FROM repository_connection;"
```

The table layout, the duplicate rule, and the locking behavior are documented
in
[`repository-connection-model.md`](./architecture/repository-connection-model.md#persistence).

## 7. Trigger the supported push scenario

`push` is the only supported event. The Control Plane answers `202 Accepted`
for a verified `push`, `200 OK` with outcome `IGNORED` for `ping` and every
other verified event, and rejects an invalid envelope or signature before any
downstream processing. The full validation order and response contract are in
[`github-webhook-ingress.md`](./architecture/github-webhook-ingress.md).

### 7.1 Signed local delivery

This reproduces exactly how GitHub signs a delivery, needs no public tunnel,
and is the form a reviewer can run.

The body is written to a file and the digest is computed over that file's
bytes, then the same file is sent with `--data-binary`. Passing the JSON as a
command-line argument is avoided on purpose: Windows PowerShell 5.1 strips the
embedded double quotes from arguments handed to a native executable, so the
bytes sent would no longer match the bytes signed and the Control Plane would
answer `401`. The secret is loaded from the file created in
[Section 4.2](#42-control-plane), because this shell is not the one that
started the Control Plane.

```powershell
$secretFile = Join-Path $HOME '.zeroyaml-webhook-secret'
$secret = [IO.File]::ReadAllText($secretFile)
$payloadFile = Join-Path ([IO.Path]::GetTempPath()) 'zeroyaml-push.json'
[IO.File]::WriteAllText($payloadFile, '{"ref":"refs/heads/main","after":"0f4b1a1e2c3d4e5f60718293a4b5c6d7e8f90a1b"}')

$hmac = New-Object System.Security.Cryptography.HMACSHA256 -ArgumentList (,[Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes($secret))
$digest = ($hmac.ComputeHash([IO.File]::ReadAllBytes($payloadFile)) |
  ForEach-Object { $_.ToString('x2') }) -join ''

curl.exe -i -X POST http://localhost:8080/webhooks/github `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  -H "X-GitHub-Event: push" `
  -H "X-GitHub-Delivery: 72d3162e-cc78-11e3-81ab-4c9367dc0958" `
  -H "X-Hub-Signature-256: sha256=$digest" `
  --data-binary "@$payloadFile"
```

```bash
secret="$(cat "$HOME/.zeroyaml-webhook-secret")"
payload_file="$(mktemp)"
printf '%s' '{"ref":"refs/heads/main","after":"0f4b1a1e2c3d4e5f60718293a4b5c6d7e8f90a1b"}' > "$payload_file"

digest="$(openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac "$secret" -hex "$payload_file" | awk '{print $NF}')"

curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8080/webhooks/github \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-GitHub-Event: push" \
  -H "X-GitHub-Delivery: 72d3162e-cc78-11e3-81ab-4c9367dc0958" \
  -H "X-Hub-Signature-256: sha256=$digest" \
  --data-binary "@$payload_file"
```

Expected response:

```text
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted

{"deliveryId":"72d3162e-cc78-11e3-81ab-4c9367dc0958","event":"push","outcome":"ACCEPTED","message":"delivery accepted for processing"}
```

Expected Control Plane log lines, in this order:

```text
INFO  i.z.c.g.w.LoggingGitHubWebhookDeliveryHandler  : GitHub delivery 72d3162e-... for event push recorded without further processing (<n> payload bytes)
INFO  i.z.c.g.w.GitHubWebhookController              : Accepted GitHub delivery 72d3162e-... for event push (<n> payload bytes)
```

The controller logs `Accepted` only after the delivery handler returns, so the
handler line comes first and is the current end of the chain. The delivery handler writes an
audit record and starts no pipeline work, which is the expected behavior until
[#20](https://github.com/MohamedMBG/ZeroYaml/issues/20) normalizes accepted
deliveries. Neither line contains the payload or the signature.

Each negative check below proves the authentication gate rather than the happy
path, so each is worth running once:

| Change to the request | Expected |
| --- | --- |
| Corrupt one character of the digest | `401`, outcome `REJECTED`, `WARN` log, no handler line |
| Drop the `X-Hub-Signature-256` header | `401`, outcome `REJECTED` |
| `X-GitHub-Event: ping`, digest recomputed | `200`, outcome `IGNORED` |
| `X-GitHub-Event: pull_request`, digest recomputed | `200`, outcome `IGNORED` |
| Drop the `X-GitHub-Delivery` header | `400`, outcome `REJECTED` |
| `Content-Type: text/plain` | `415`, outcome `REJECTED` |
| Body above `zeroyaml.github.webhook.max-payload-size` | `413`, outcome `REJECTED` |

An unverified delivery is rejected before the event allow-list is consulted, so
an unauthenticated caller cannot learn which events the endpoint acts on.

### 7.2 Delivery from GitHub itself

To drive the same endpoint from a real repository, expose port `8080` through a
tunnel of your choice and configure the repository webhook with the tunnel URL
plus `/webhooks/github`, content type `application/json`, the same secret as
`ZEROYAML_GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, and the `push` event only. GitHub sends one
`ping` when the webhook is created: a `200` with outcome `IGNORED` confirms the
secret matches. GitHub's **Recent Deliveries** view then shows each push with
the Control Plane's response body, and any delivery can be redelivered from
there instead of pushing again.

## 8. Observe one job execution

Nothing in the Control Plane creates or dispatches a Job yet
([#23](https://github.com/MohamedMBG/ZeroYaml/issues/23),
[#24](https://github.com/MohamedMBG/ZeroYaml/issues/24)), so the execution half
is exercised by dispatching one `RunJob` by hand. This verifies the Runner
sandbox, the status-report contract, and the Control Plane's reconciliation of
a report — the parts [#30](https://github.com/MohamedMBG/ZeroYaml/issues/30)
will drive from a push.

Prepare a source repository below `ZEROYAML_RUNNER_LOCAL_SOURCE_ROOT`:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory C:\zeroyaml-sources\demo | Out-Null
Push-Location C:\zeroyaml-sources\demo
git init --initial-branch=main
'hello' | Out-File -Encoding ascii greeting.txt
git add greeting.txt
git commit -m "add greeting"
$revision = git rev-parse HEAD
Pop-Location
```

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/zeroyaml-sources/demo"
cd "$HOME/zeroyaml-sources/demo"
git init --initial-branch=main
echo 'hello' > greeting.txt
git add greeting.txt
git commit -m "add greeting"
revision="$(git rev-parse HEAD)"
cd -
```

Run the bash dispatch below in the same shell, so `$revision` is still set; an
empty revision fails request validation.

Dispatch it. The Runner registers no gRPC reflection service, so `grpcurl` is
pointed at the contract in `proto/`:

```powershell
$request = @{
  protocol_version = 'runner.v1'
  job = @{
    job_id     = [guid]::NewGuid().ToString()
    repository = @{ location = 'file:///C:/zeroyaml-sources/demo'; revision = $revision }
    execution  = @{ command = @('sh', '-c', 'cat greeting.txt'); working_directory = '.' }
  }
} | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 5

$request | grpcurl -plaintext -import-path proto -proto runner/v1/runner.proto `
  -d @ localhost:50051 zeroyaml.runner.v1.RunnerService/RunJob
```

```bash
grpcurl -plaintext -import-path proto -proto runner/v1/runner.proto -d @ \
  localhost:50051 zeroyaml.runner.v1.RunnerService/RunJob <<JSON
{
  "protocol_version": "runner.v1",
  "job": {
    "job_id": "$(uuidgen)",
    "repository": { "location": "file://$HOME/zeroyaml-sources/demo", "revision": "$revision" },
    "execution": { "command": ["sh", "-c", "cat greeting.txt"], "working_directory": "." }
  }
}
JSON
```

Expected acknowledgment. It reports acceptance only, never the outcome, because
a dispatch must not block on job duration:

```json
{
  "jobId": "<uuid>",
  "acceptance": "JOB_ACCEPTED",
  "runnerId": "local-runner",
  "instanceId": "<uuid>"
}
```

Expected Runner records: the dispatch acknowledgment, a running status report,
the execution result, and one terminal report. They never contain the repository location, the
revision, the command arguments, or the failure message.

```text
level=INFO msg="run job acknowledged" job_id=<uuid> protocol_version=runner.v1 runner_id=local-runner instance_id=<uuid> acceptance=JOB_ACCEPTED
level=WARN msg="job status report acknowledged" job_id=<uuid> reported_state=running runner_id=local-runner instance_id=<uuid> decision=unknown_job job_state=unspecified
level=INFO msg="job execution finished" job_id=<uuid> execution_id=<id> outcome=succeeded duration=<d> exit_code=0
level=WARN msg="job status report acknowledged" job_id=<uuid> reported_state=succeeded runner_id=local-runner instance_id=<uuid> decision=unknown_job job_state=unspecified
```

Expected Control Plane records:

```text
WARN  i.z.c.e.JobExecutionStatusRecorder : Job <uuid> reported RUNNING by runner local-runner instance <uuid> was refused: ...
WARN  i.z.c.e.JobExecutionStatusRecorder : Job <uuid> reported SUCCEEDED by runner local-runner instance <uuid> was refused: ...
```

`decision=unknown_job` is the correct answer here, not a defect. The Control
Plane owns authoritative Job state and never invents a Job from a report, and a
hand-dispatched Job was never recorded because nothing creates Jobs yet. Once
[#23](https://github.com/MohamedMBG/ZeroYaml/issues/23) records created Jobs,
the same two reports are answered `applied` with `job_state` `running` and then
`succeeded`.

Docker checks for the same execution:

```powershell
# While the job runs: the checkout container, then the job container.
docker ps --filter label=io.zeroyaml.managed=true

# After it ends, on any outcome: nothing is left behind.
docker ps -a --filter label=io.zeroyaml.managed=true
docker volume ls --filter label=io.zeroyaml.managed=true
```

Both post-run commands are expected to list nothing. Every container and the
workspace volume are removed whether the command succeeded, failed, timed out,
or was cancelled. The workspace strategy, resource bounds, result mapping, and
known limits are documented in
[`runner-execution-sandbox.md`](./architecture/runner-execution-sandbox.md).

For the failure path, dispatch `sh -c 'exit 3'`. The terminal report then
carries state `failed` with reason `non_zero_exit` and exit code `3`, and the
Runner still removes every resource.

## 9. Expected states

### Job lifecycle

The Control Plane owns these states
([`JobStatus`](../control-plane/src/main/java/io/zeroyaml/controlplane/domain/job/JobStatus.java),
mirrored to the Runner as `JobLifecycleState`):

| State | Meaning | Reached by | Observable today |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CREATED` | The Job exists and has not been offered to a Runner | Job creation from a pipeline | No — [#23](https://github.com/MohamedMBG/ZeroYaml/issues/23) |
| `QUEUED` | The Job is waiting for a Runner | A Control Plane scheduling decision a Runner never observes or reports | No — [#24](https://github.com/MohamedMBG/ZeroYaml/issues/24) |
| `RUNNING` | The Runner reported `JOB_EXECUTION_RUNNING` | An accepted `RunJob`, then a running report | The report is sent and reconciled ([Section 8](#8-observe-one-job-execution)); it is applied only once Jobs are recorded |
| `SUCCEEDED` | The command exited `0` | Terminal report `JOB_EXECUTION_SUCCEEDED` | As above |
| `FAILED` | Non-zero exit, timeout, cancellation, or execution error | Terminal report `JOB_EXECUTION_FAILED` with a failure reason | As above |
| `CANCELLED` | The Control Plane stopped the Job | A Control Plane decision. A Runner reports a cancelled execution as `FAILED` with reason `cancelled` and never reports `CANCELLED` | No |

A report is applied only when it advances the Job. A duplicate, late, or
contradicting report is answered `duplicate`, `unknown_job`, or `conflict` and
leaves state untouched, which is what makes the call safe to repeat. A terminal
report repeats the execution start time, so a lost running report cannot leave
a finished execution without a Job outcome. The full reconciliation and failure
rules are in
[`job-status-contract.md`](./architecture/job-status-contract.md).

### Runner liveness

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `HEALTHY` | A registration or heartbeat was acknowledged within `zeroyaml.registration.heartbeat-timeout` |
| `UNAVAILABLE` | That window passed without one |

Liveness is derived on demand from the last acknowledged contact. There is no
background sweep and no distributed failure detector.

### Persistence checks

| Check | Command | Expected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Schema applied | `docker exec -i zeroyaml-postgres psql -U zeroyaml -d zeroyaml -c "\dt"` | `repository_connection` and Flyway's `flyway_schema_history` |
| Migration recorded | `... -c "SELECT version, description, success FROM flyway_schema_history;"` | `1`, `success = t` |
| Connection row | `... -c "SELECT provider, owner, name, status FROM repository_connection;"` | The row from [Section 6](#6-connect-a-repository) |
| Connection survives a restart | Restart the Control Plane, repeat the row check | The row is still present |
| Job state survives a restart | — | Not expected. Jobs are held in a process-local store and are lost on restart until [#28](https://github.com/MohamedMBG/ZeroYaml/issues/28) |

Captured Job logs have no persistence check yet; log streaming is
[#26](https://github.com/MohamedMBG/ZeroYaml/issues/26). Until then, command
output is visible only in the Job container's own output.

## 10. Troubleshooting

### GitHub webhook

| Symptom | Cause | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Startup fails with `zeroyaml.github.webhook.secret must be set to at least 16 characters` | The secret is missing or too short | Set `ZEROYAML_GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in the shell that starts the Control Plane; it is never read from a tracked file |
| `401`, outcome `REJECTED`, no handler log line | The signature is missing, malformed, or was computed with a different secret | Recompute the digest over the exact bytes sent, with no trailing newline, and confirm the GitHub webhook secret matches the environment value |
| `400`, outcome `REJECTED` | `X-GitHub-Event` or `X-GitHub-Delivery` is missing, or the body is not a JSON object | Send both headers and a JSON object body |
| `415` | The content type is not JSON | Use `Content-Type: application/json`, and set the same on the GitHub webhook |
| `413` | The payload is above `zeroyaml.github.webhook.max-payload-size` | Raise the limit, up to GitHub's 25 MB cap, or send a smaller payload |
| `200`, outcome `IGNORED`, for a push | `X-GitHub-Event` is not `push` | `push` is the only supported event; `ping` and all others are ignored by design |
| `202` but no pipeline runs | Expected today | The delivery handler only writes an audit line until [#20](https://github.com/MohamedMBG/ZeroYaml/issues/20) |
| GitHub reports a delivery error while local `curl` works | The tunnel is down or the URL is wrong | Fix the tunnel, then redeliver from **Recent Deliveries** rather than pushing again |

### gRPC

| Symptom | Cause | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Runner registration with the Control Plane at localhost:50052 failed - runner local-runner stays unavailable` | The Control Plane is not started, or listens elsewhere | Start the Control Plane first, or set `ZEROYAML_CONTROLPLANE_ADDRESS` to its `zeroyaml.registration.port` |
| Registration rejected as an identity conflict | Another process already registered this `ZEROYAML_RUNNER_ID` under a different instance | Stop the other Runner, or give this one a distinct `ZEROYAML_RUNNER_ID` |
| Every dispatch answered `JOB_REJECTION_RUNNER_UNAVAILABLE` | Registration was not accepted, or Docker was unavailable at startup | Fix the cause, then restart the Runner; both checks run once at startup |
| Dispatch answered `JOB_REJECTION_UNSUPPORTED_PROTOCOL_VERSION` | `protocol_version` is not `runner.v1` | Send the version declared in `proto/runner/v1/runner.proto` |
| Dispatch fails with `INVALID_ARGUMENT` and no response body | A contract violation, such as a missing job identity or an empty command | Fix the request; a caller defect is deliberately not answered with a rejection |
| Heartbeats answered `HEARTBEAT_UNKNOWN_RUNNER` | The Control Plane restarted and lost its in-memory registry | Restart the Runner so it registers again |
| Control Plane startup fails with `Failed to start the runner-facing gRPC server on port 50052` | The port is already bound | Stop the other process, or change `zeroyaml.registration.port` and `ZEROYAML_CONTROLPLANE_ADDRESS` together |
| `grpcurl` reports an unknown service | The Runner registers no reflection service | Pass `-import-path proto -proto runner/v1/runner.proto` |

### Docker

| Symptom | Cause | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docker daemon unavailable - runner will not accept jobs` | The daemon is not running, or did not answer within 5 s | Start Docker Desktop, confirm `docker version`, then restart the Runner |
| Terminal report with reason `execution_error` | The workspace or the executor could not be prepared, for example a missing image | Pre-pull `ZEROYAML_RUNNER_JOB_IMAGE` and `ZEROYAML_RUNNER_CHECKOUT_IMAGE` |
| Dispatch fails with `FAILED_PRECONDITION`, naming the scheme | The repository scheme is not `https`, `http`, or `file` | Use a supported scheme; other git transports can run arbitrary commands and are refused |
| Dispatch fails with `FAILED_PRECONDITION`: `file repository locations are disabled on this runner` | `ZEROYAML_RUNNER_LOCAL_SOURCE_ROOT` is unset | Set it to an existing absolute directory and restart the Runner |
| Dispatch fails with `FAILED_PRECONDITION`: `file repository location is outside the configured local source root` | The path escapes the root, including through a symlink | Move the source below the root; containment is checked after symlinks are resolved |
| Terminal report with reason `timeout` | The execution exceeded `ZEROYAML_RUNNER_JOB_TIMEOUT` | Raise the timeout or shorten the command; the checkout counts toward the same budget |
| Containers or volumes left behind after a crash | The Runner exited before cleanup finished | Remove them by label: `docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq --filter label=io.zeroyaml.managed=true)`, then `docker volume prune --filter label=io.zeroyaml.managed=true` |
| `go test ./...` fails in `internal/sandbox` | Container tests were opted into without a usable daemon | Unset `ZEROYAML_RUNNER_DOCKER_TESTS`, or start Docker |
| Control Plane tests cannot start a container | Testcontainers needs a reachable daemon | Start Docker; these tests use a disposable `postgres:16-alpine` and never the compose database |

### PostgreSQL

| Symptom | Cause | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Startup fails with `no password was provided` | `ZEROYAML_DATABASE_PASSWORD` is unset | Export it in the shell that starts the Control Plane |
| Startup fails with a refused connection after about 5 s | The database is unreachable; connection acquisition is bounded at 5 s on purpose | `docker compose -f ./infra/compose.yaml up -d postgres`, then confirm `5432` is published |
| `password authentication failed for user "zeroyaml"` | The password differs from the compose value | Align the environment value with `infra/compose.yaml`, or point `ZEROYAML_DATABASE_URL` at the right database |
| Startup fails with a Flyway validation error | The volume holds a schema from an edited migration | Applied migrations are immutable: add a new versioned migration, or discard local data with `docker compose -f ./infra/compose.yaml down -v` |
| An insert is rejected by a check constraint | The row contradicts the domain rules | Use lowercase `owner` and `name`, provider `GITHUB`, a valid status, and `status_changed_at >= connected_at` |
| An insert is rejected by `repository_connection_identity_key` | The repository is already connected | Update the existing row; one repository can be connected only once |
| Requests fail after about 5 s | The statement timeout is bounded at 5 s | Investigate the slow statement; an unreachable or stalled database fails fast by design |

## 11. Automated coverage

Run both suites from the repository root before proposing a change:

```powershell
Push-Location control-plane
.\mvnw.cmd --batch-mode verify
Pop-Location

Push-Location runner
go test ./...
Pop-Location
```

Container-backed Runner tests are opt-in, because they need a daemon, `git`,
and the configured images:

```powershell
Push-Location runner
$env:ZEROYAML_RUNNER_DOCKER_TESTS = '1'
go test -count=1 -run TestDockerExecution ./internal/sandbox/
Remove-Item Env:ZEROYAML_RUNNER_DOCKER_TESTS
Pop-Location
```

What the suites already cover, per step of this document:

| Step | Covered by |
| --- | --- |
| Webhook envelope, signature, event allow-list, response contract | Control Plane `github.webhook` tests |
| Repository connection persistence and constraints | Control Plane `connection` tests, against a Testcontainers PostgreSQL |
| Registration, heartbeat, and derived liveness | Control Plane `registration` tests; Runner `registrationclient` and `heartbeat` tests |
| `RunJob` validation, acceptance, and rejection | Runner `grpcserver` tests, including over the transport |
| Container execution, cleanup, and result mapping | Runner `sandbox` tests; `TestDockerExecution*` for real containers |
| Status reporting and reconciliation | Runner `jobstatus` tests; Control Plane `execution` tests |
| A push through to an execution | Not covered — [#31](https://github.com/MohamedMBG/ZeroYaml/issues/31) |

No automated test spans a push to an execution yet, so the two halves in
Sections 7 and 8 rest on a reading of the code and have not been run end to end. When
[#31](https://github.com/MohamedMBG/ZeroYaml/issues/31) lands, this document
must be checked against that test and corrected wherever the two disagree; the
test is authoritative.

## 12. Shut down

```powershell
# Stop the Runner, then the Control Plane: Ctrl+C in each shell.
docker compose -f .\infra\compose.yaml down
```

The Runner stops on `SIGINT` or `SIGTERM` by closing its listener, draining
in-flight RPCs, and cancelling running executions, all inside one
`ZEROYAML_RUNNER_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT` budget measured from the signal. If that
budget runs out it logs `runner exited before every job execution finished` and
exits, leaving labelled Docker resources to be removed as described under
[Docker](#docker).

`down` keeps the `postgres-data` volume, so connected-repository rows survive.
Add `-v` to discard the local database as well.
