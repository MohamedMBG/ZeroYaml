# Minimal Pipeline Model

The Control Plane owns `Pipeline`. A pipeline is the ordered plan ZeroYAML
decided to run for one repository revision. It sits between repository
inference and executable Jobs:

```text
repository inference ──> Pipeline ──> one Job per step ──> Runner
        (#22)             (#21)            (#23)
```

The model is deliberately narrow. ZeroYAML infers useful execution plans; it
does not reimplement a general workflow language. The model has no triggers,
matrices, reusable workflows, secret definitions, conditions, or deployment
graphs, and it carries no provider payloads or Runner transport types. The
types live in `io.zeroyaml.controlplane.domain.pipeline`.

## Model contents

| Concept | Representation |
| --- | --- |
| Identity | `PipelineId`, backed by a UUID |
| Source context | The Job model's `RepositoryReference`: provider-neutral URI plus immutable revision |
| Steps | Ordered `List<PipelineStep>`, at least one and at most 50 |
| Step identity | `PipelineStep.name`, unique within the pipeline |
| Step execution | The Job model's `ExecutionDefinition`: argument list plus working directory |
| Outcome | `PipelineStatus` and, for a failed pipeline, `PipelineFailure` |

A step reuses `ExecutionDefinition` and a pipeline reuses `RepositoryReference`,
so a step becomes a Job without translation: the pipeline's `source()` plus the
step's `execution()` are exactly the inputs of `Job.create`. The command stays an
argument list rather than a shell script, as in the Job model.

## Validation rules

Construction is the validation point, and an invalid value is rejected with
`IllegalArgumentException` (`NullPointerException` for a missing required
object). An existing `Pipeline` is therefore always executable.

- A pipeline must have an identity, a source, and at least one step.
- A pipeline must not have more than 50 steps, which keeps the Jobs created from
  it finite.
- A pipeline must not contain a missing step.
- Step names must be unique. The rejection message names the duplicate.
- A step name is 1 to 64 characters of lowercase letters, digits, `.`, `_`, and
  `-`, starting and ending with a letter or digit. Names are never trimmed or
  case-folded, so `unit-test` and `unit_test` are different steps.
- A step's command and working directory follow the Job model's
  `ExecutionDefinition` rules.

## Ordering and identity

Steps run strictly one after another in the order they were supplied. The order
is preserved exactly: it is never sorted by name and never reordered. The
supplied list is copied, so a later change to it cannot alter the pipeline, and
the exposed list is unmodifiable. A pipeline is identified by its `PipelineId`
and a step by its name within that pipeline.

## Status and failure

`PipelineStatus` is `PENDING`, `RUNNING`, `SUCCEEDED`, or `FAILED`; the last two
are terminal. `PipelineFailure` records the name of the failed step, a stable
failure code, and a safe diagnostic message. These are value types only. The
rules that move a pipeline between states, including cancellation, belong to
the Phase 3 pipeline lifecycle work.

## Out of scope

Repository inspection and inference rules (#22), creating and dispatching Jobs
from a pipeline (#23), persistence (#28), Docker-specific details, and
compatibility with any workflow YAML format.
